This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory (\testr), you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`


Things left to finish:
load jsons from links
finish heights/fonts/paddings and propper spacing on the css/grid objects
add other tabs







Goal
○ Build the main page according to design
○ Use any 3rd party library/framework where it makes sense.
○ UI library - choose one of the following (sorted by our preference) - React, Vue, Angular
○ Link to design - Zeplin

○ JSON data for display: initial_data.json
○ The design should be responsive (on a best-effort basis)
○ You are provided with images within Zeplin where needed (for example, do not draw the
graphs manually)
○ Functionality:
a. Be able to switch from main tab to other tabs - other tabs should feature a stub
content (like “SAMPLE PAGE” or “Lorem ipsum..” text)
b. Tapping on Send in Support Requests table should mark the respective line as
“Sent”
c. “Add” button - adds a random line to table at its top - pick data from
additional_data.json

Instructions
○ The amount of time invested should be up to 3 hours

● Your engineering assumptions
● Solution thought process
● What you would do differently in a production environment
● Parts not handled/not handled optimally on purpose and why
● Execution instructions
